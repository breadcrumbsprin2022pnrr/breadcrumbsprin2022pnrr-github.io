    <h2>Detailed description of the project</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Research objectives</h3>
    <p class="text-left">
        In this project, we focus our investigation on Urban Air Mobility (UAM). We consider missions in the Specific category with the
    additional low-altitude constraint enforced by the Open category (i.e., within 120 m) ignoring the manned-unmanned risk. We
    concentrate our attention on two types of missions: i) suburban missions: UAVs fly in areas loosely populated for collecting
    images/data or for performing aerial work such as pest monitoring or data collection on orchards, or monitoring natural
    or artificial corridors like rivers, electricity, and gas pipelines; and ii) urban missions: UAVs fly in cluttered areas, medium or highly
    populated, for structural health monitoring of buildings, traffic monitoring on train railways and highways, and delivery of food
    and beverage, small parcel mails, or biomedical goods. Reliable BVLoS links are thought to extend the operative radius of the UAV
    service in both types of missions, which have a different level of risk: the suburban missions have generally negligible air and ground
    risk, while the urban missions face much higher air and ground risks. For our scope, we need novel enabling technologies to
    implement a robust BVLoS flight that guarantees a degree of connectivity and incorporates a risk tolerance at a proper level,
    commensurate with the offered service.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="img/big_picture.png" alt="scenario" class="img-fluid mb-3" id="scenario-main">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="text-left">
    The connectivity is needed to control the UAV beyond the horizon of the operator’s vision and beyond the Ground Control Station’s
    (GCS) transmission range. We are not thinking of creating an ad-hoc infrastructure for letting the UAVs fly in BVLoS because it would
    have a negative environmental impact, and would be extremely costly.
    Therefore, we aim to exploit the available wireless communication technology used for other common purposes, like the cellular infrastructure that is regularly used
    by billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
    In case a singular cellular infrastructure does not fully cover the entire aerial space (nor to certify
    the coverage in certain areas), we plan to rely on a secondary (redundant) technology (as a backup), such as the satellite
    infrastructure. Since these communication infrastructures (cellular and satellite) comprise different generations of technologies, each
    of them with different coverage, bandwidth, reliability, latency, and so on, our objective is to deal with these similar but
    heterogeneous technologies/interfaces in order to guarantee a seamless BVLoS flight of UAVs. Nevertheless, there are other
    challenges to be addressed when studying connectivity. In fact, since the UAVs will be equipped with many additional wireless
    transceivers increasing their weight and CPU burden, the flight time will be negatively affected. Moreover, even if the ground
    infrastructure is potentially suitable for the UAVs, current exceptional events can cause a saturation of the network, and hence
    increase latency or, even worse, possible BVLoS links disruptions. To this end, we propose a robust connectivity analysis by taking
    into account the communication channel quality and the required constraints.
    <br>
    <br>
    The risk awareness helps the UAVs to be aware in advance of the possible ground and air risks. So, our goal is to build the UAV risk
    awareness by merging real-time information with the information stored in ground and air maps, static or dynamic. It will be of
    different levels by relying on onboard sensors and on the UAV control technology. The onboard risk awareness is implemented
    by equipping the UAVs with a set of visual and proximity sensors so that they can measure and estimate in real-time the distance
    between any object in the surrounding area. It can be also enhanced with the feedback provided by possible additional cameras
    (e.g., RGB, thermal). The UAV control technology, instead, leveraging on ground maps, limits the risks of the UAV flight. For instance,
    it can inform the UAV well in advance, with respect to the onboard sensors, about the presence of static obstacles, no-fly zones, and
    so on. The maps that describe and constrain specific areas on the ground/air can be retrieved from many providers such as
    OpenStreetMap or D-Flight. The content of the maps can be queried by the control infrastructures to guide the UAV during
    the flight. We also propose an advanced risk awareness by considering the dynamic aspects of the environment, possibly requiring
    communications from different entities operating in the environment during the UAV flight.
    <br><br>
    So, the important objectives to be pursued in this project are the implementation of seamless, efficient, and reliable BVLoS links, and
    the creation of a model that properly builds the risk awareness for the UAV by extracting data from the onboard sensors, and from
    the information provided by the UAV control technology.
    <br><br>
    In the following, we describe how we intend to split our project into milestones (MLs), tasks (Ts), and deliverables (Ds). ML1 concerns
    general activities that span the whole project, while ML2 investigates the preliminary BVLoS in suburban missions in order to lay the
    foundations for the subsequent and more challenging BVLoS in urban missions (ML3). POLITO will address concerns about the
    connectivity required during the flight (i.e., communication channel quality, constraints, and strategies for optimizing the QoS), UNIFI
    will study the possible risks that can occur to UAVs (i.e., safety risk assessment process and security and safety robustness UAV
    system evaluation), and finally, UNIPG will devise efficient routing and scheduling algorithms taking into account both the
    connectivity and the risk assessment, possibly extended to multiple UAVs.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>ML1: General Activities</h3>
    <p class="text-left">
    This milestone, which spans the whole project, is used to describe general activities that will support the core of our research, such
    as the study of the state-of-the-art, implementation and evaluation, and management, dissemination, and exploitation.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h4>T1.1 – [UNIPG, UNIFI, POLITO; B1-B2, B6-B7] State-of-the-art analysis and requirements</h4>
    <p class="text-left">
    This task will start to analyze the current state-of-the-art. All the RUs will do this task in order to build the required knowledge for the
    next milestones/activities. Concerning the communications, for each type of available network (different generations of cellular
    communications), we will analyze its range, distribution, bandwidth, latency, energy, and overhead cost. We will also analyze
    satellite communications in the case that both cellular and satellite infrastructures will be jointly used. As for
    the risk model, we will revise the literature on ground and air risk. For example, we must revise how the risks are assessed, how the
    ground information is freely available, and how malicious devices can somehow deceive UAVs during a BVLoS flight. Finally,
    concerning the routing of drones, we should investigate the key parameters to be optimized during the flight (energy, overhead,
    quality of the signal).
    For each area of the project (communications, risks, and routing), at the end of this task, we will propose a set of key functional
    requirements for the suburban and urban missions, respectively, that will drive the design of the BVLoS solution proposed by this
    project.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h4>T1.2 – [UNIPG, UNIFI, POLITO; B4-B6, B10-B12] Implementation and evaluation</h4>
    <p class="text-left">
    In this task, we implement our proposed methodologies (models, analysis, algorithms), and then evaluate the real effectiveness.
    Specifically, we consider first the implementation of BVLoS flights in suburban scenarios, and then in the urban scenarios.
    The algorithms will be designed and evaluated from a theoretical point of view, comparing them against state-of-the-art techniques.
    We also plan to validate the theoretical results obtained in our research project and the proposed approaches through experiments
    in simulated and real-world environments. Experiments can raise new conjectures and theoretical questions that may lead to further
    theoretical improvements and eventually to more solutions. All the RUs will do this task. Initially, each RU will focus on the
    implementation/assessment and evaluation of its specific area, and then we expect to convey our findings in order to evaluate the
    final effectiveness of the whole proposed BVLoS system.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h4>T1.3 – [UNIPG, UNIFI, POLITO; B4-B12] Management, dissemination, and exploitation</h4>
    <p class="text-left">
    In this task, we plan a suitable management, dissemination, and exploitation scheme. The management will be organized by the
    lead RU (UNIPG) which will follow up on deliverables and milestones. The lead RU will monitor the progress and identify roadblocks,
    make sure all deliverables have been met, and finalize the project. The goal is also to cover both scientific dissemination and
    exploitation of the project’s objectives, adopted approaches, and of obtained results. The effort will be allocated to
    document demonstrators, research prototypes, and provide open-source code and other supporting materials. A project web space
    will be created to provide an information point for the work of the project. The project results, research findings, and outcomes will
    be publicly disseminated through seminar talks, and also published in highly reputable international scientific journals and
    conferences, possibly under the open-access option. In particular, we expect a productive scientific dissemination,
    which can be quantified in 6 top-rank journal papers and 6 conference papers (on average, 3 journal and 3 conference papers per
    year). Additionally, at least 2 journal publications will be co-authored by ALL the RUs, which describes the proposed approach as a
    cohesive work, where all RUs have a fundamental role in its success. To promote the dissemination of results to the community, two
    dissemination events will be organized, in the form of workshops, possibly co-located in top conferences.
    Internally, we will have a joint secure cloud space for several services, i.e., source code repository, storage, web space, and so on.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>ML2: BVLoS in Suburban Missions</h3>
    <p class="text-left">
    In this milestone, our goal is to enable Specific BVLoS suburban missions for collecting images/data or for performing aerial work
    such as spraying on agriculture, or monitoring natural or artificial corridors like rivers, electricity, and gas pipelines, just to mention a
    few. In particular, our target will be pursued by: analyzing the link quality and constraints of the suburban scenario and
    characterizing the relationship between the cellular networks on the ground, and the UAVs (T2.1); analyzing the
    risk of UAVs by relying on a properly modeled safety risk assessment process (T2.2); and defining the routing parameters to be
    optimized for an efficient flight that considers both the connectivity and risk assessment processes (T2.3). Eventually, we expect to
    produce Deliverable D2 that summarizes the activities expected for BVLoS flights in suburban missions describing our findings,
    results, implementations, and simulation evaluation.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h4>T2.1 – [POLITO; B2-B6] Communication channel quality and constraints</h4>
    <p class="text-left">
    In this task, we define the communication channel quality and constraints, which is a mandatory step for enabling the BVLoS flight.
    This will be done by taking into account the existing communication infrastructures, starting from the already available cellular
    ground infrastructure (i.e., 2/3/4/5G). This infrastructure, mainly optimized for ground users, is basically made by a network of
    cellular towers whose antennas are placed at a certain height above the ground. Since these antennas are directional and they are pointing towards the ground, the connectivity can be an issue in the air.
    The investigation consists in defining many types of
    aspects, starting from the channel quality in terms of key performance indicators like bit rate, and error probability.
    We also need to
    study possible additional constraints, like the maximum distance between the transmitter and the receiver, the time to handover,
    the expected number of handovers per unit of covered distance (which depends on the cell size), and so on.
    Furthermore, we
    propose models of the cost (in terms of energy and latency) that characterize possible handovers among intra- and
    inter-technologies. The selected models will have to be simple in order to be easily incorporated into decision routing algorithms and
    strategies that will optimize the flight of UAVs. Moreover, we also plan to evaluate possible signal noises caused by the
    non-obstructed environment at relatively low altitudes (i.e., suburban areas). This is because the current cellular infrastructure has
    been built for an environment with obstacles. Therefore, since the drones fly over the buildings, there is not any obstruction, and
    hence the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is increased in the nearby towers.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h4>T2.2 – [UNIFI; B2-B6] Safety risk assessment process</h4>
    <p class="text-left">
    In this task, we provide an adaptable modeling framework for safety analyses, focusing on BVLoS operations, that allows the
    assurance of operational safety. Hence, we model the accidental faults that involve the UAV itself, including the connectivity
    disruptions. In particular, as for the UAV failures, key model parameters, like those abstracting the failure rate of a hardware
    component, are usually meant to be static. In this case, instead, they have to be adapted to a dynamic environment where the
    environment conditions (e.g., weather, UAV velocity) can influence the failure rate. A hardware component failure impacts the
    ground risk, while the communication link failure exposes the UAV control to be risky. The key elements of the proposed modeling
    approach concern its capability to capture the dynamic nature of the system elements that may have an impact on the offered level
    of safety, and its capability to be applied to a variety of scenarios. The adaptable modeling framework will be based on a preliminary
    risk assessment process encompassing safety issues. We will first conduct a qualitative analysis for identifying the safety
    hazards in the system that might lead to catastrophic consequences. Moreover, a quantitative analysis can start to define which
    failures can be the object of resilient solutions. For example, having an uncontrollable UAV is generally unacceptable, but a
    connectivity outage can be tolerated by resilient solutions in a suburban environment if it is “short enough”. Traditional risk
    assessment techniques, like hazard and operability study (HAZOP) or failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) (i.e., the process of
    reviewing as many components, assemblies, and subsystems as possible to identify potential failure modes in a system and their
    causes and effects), will be tailored for being effectively applied to the BVLoS domain.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h4>T2.3 – [UNIPG; B2-B6] Routing algorithms for BVLoS in suburban mission</h4>
    <p class="text-left">
    In this task, we initially create the system model which is at the basis of our BVLoS scenario. It should take into account both the
    mobility of the drone and some detailed information about the environment that surrounds the flights. So, we aim to design a
    system model based on a multi-layer framework in which each layer contains useful data, such as coverage of the communication
    towers, obstacles, weather maps, rechargeable stations, no-fly zones, and ground risks. Thus, the objective is to devise efficient
    routing algorithms that allow the UAVs to fly BVLoS in suburban missions by taking into account the connectivity and the risk
    assessment process. In other words, given a starting and a destination point, we need to determine the “most suitable” BVLoS route
    such that the UAV can autonomously reach its destination, optimizing metrics that measure and balance sustainability, efficiency,
    connectivity, and risk. If the time complexity for getting the optimal solutions would be too high, we will target sub-optimal but faster
    approximated (and heuristic) solutions. We also plan to take possible countermeasures in the case the UAVs enter “fail-safe mode”,
    providing a set of “checkpoints” along the route where the drone can land, whenever the self-diagnostic system detects a
    malfunction, but still within functioning capabilities. To improve the resilience of the connectivity, we can assume drones are forced
    to be connected to at least two different types of links (e.g., 2G and 5G). Having this redundancy is important in order to always
    guarantee communications with the drone, although with different network capabilities. Finally, the routing algorithms will be tuned
    with respect to the application of interest. For instance, if the drone is recording and transmitting a video in livestreaming then it will
    need to maintain excellent communication at any time, without interfering too much with the other users. Conversely, in package
    delivery applications, only a few data need to be exchanged with the GCS.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>ML3: BVLoS in Urban Missions</h3>
    <p class="text-left">
    In this milestone, based on the new acquired knowledge, our goal is to investigate the Specific BVLoS urban missions, e.g., for
    structural health monitoring of buildings, traffic monitoring on highways, monitoring of railway tracks, and delivery of food and
    beverage, small parcel mail, and biomedical goods, just to mention a few. In particular, our target will be pursued by: developing
    strategies for optimizing the Quality of Service (QoS) of the communications (T3.1); evaluating the security and safety robustness of
    the UAV system against accidental and malicious faults (T3.2); and devising advanced UAV routing and scheduling algorithms (T3.3).
    Eventually, we expect to produce Deliverable D3 that summarizes the activities expected for BVLoS flights in urban missions.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h4>T3.1 – [POLITO; B6-B12] Development of strategies for optimizing the QoS</h4>
    <p class="text-left">
    In this task, we develop possible strategies for optimizing the QoS provided to the application taking into account the channel quality
    and the predicted channel quality along the path that the UAV is taking. In fact, a UAV that is flying towards a given destination by
    accessing different technological solutions can optimize the path selection not only to guarantee continuity of connection but also to
    maximize the QoS that is required by the applications. In particular, we will consider a few cases as follows: i) in case of elastic and
    delay tolerant services, the strategy aims at maximizing the available bandwidth along the path that the UAV is taking; ii) in case of
    multimedia real-time communications, it might be convenient to guarantee an available bandwidth that is as constant as possible
    and as close as possible to the minimum requested one; iii) in case of energy minimization, for example for IoT applications, the
    scheduling of the transmissions might take into account the fact that the energy needed to transmit depends on the channel quality
    and on the selected technology. Another aspect to consider in urban environments is the presence of dense obstacles that can obstruct the signal and therefore limit the connectivity.
    Recall that a UAV must be connected all the time, with a certain level of requirements, during any BVLoS flight. In fact, in a suburban
    scenario with a few obstacles, the probability of being radio Line of Sight (LoS) is higher, but in an urban scenario, this probability
    can significantly decrease due to the presence of buildings or other obstacles. Such a LoS probability highly depends on the angle of
    incidence among the tower where the UAV is connected with, and the UAV itself, impacting the required QoS.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h4>T3.2 – [UNIFI; B6-B12] Security and safety robustness UAV system evaluation</h4>
    <p class="text-left">
    In this task, we consider security and safety issues with
    the most stringent constraints because the environment on the ground is dense and highly populated, and the buildings form a
    cluttered environment. All the previous concerns addressed in T2.2 are present here, and the models have to be adapted to the
    cluttered environment. In addition, the complicated and uncontrolled environments, the different wireless communication channels,
    and the lack of security standards for UAVs make the Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) vulnerable to attack. UAVs/UAS are a kind of
    cyber-physical system (CPS) containing multiple components like sensors, communications, computation, and control modules, so
    each element may become the object of cyber-attacks, leading the physical system into undesirable states and critical malfunctions
    that could lead to potential catastrophic consequences, thus impairing the system safety. So, it is necessary to analyze the
    cyber-physical threats and the impact of cross-domain attacks on UAVs, which is also an important research direction in the field of
    CPS security. We plan to provide the information required to experimentally evaluate the robustness of the UAS against
    accidental and malicious faults. Starting from the most likely fault modes and the most relevant attack surfaces (exploiting UAV’s
    vulnerabilities), we will investigate the operating condition of the UAV at its operational boundary, i.e., we will investigate if the UAV
    is still able to provide a correct service under the considered accidental faults and attacks. The analysis will include failures of
    the visual camera, the gyroscope, the oscillometer, and so on. As attacks, we will include at least adversarial patches (i.e., attacks
    towards visual cameras in the physical world) and disruption of wireless communications. When the injection of failures and attacks
    directly into the real prototype is not possible, simulations will be performed using the available datasets and simulators. Also, the
    presence of multiple drones in the same area can cause additional risks (e.g., colliding drones). So, the proposed approach seeks to
    begin providing an adaptable framework for analyses that allows rapid assurance of operational safety considering different
    scenarios in terms of combinations of the variability aspects of the system, like combinations of environment conditions, operational
    conditions, available communication networks, number of UAVs.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h4>T3.3 – [UNIPG; B6-B12] Routing Algorithms for BVLoS in urban mission</h4>
    <p class="text-left">
    In this task, we study efficient routing and scheduling algorithms suitable for an urban BVLoS environment. Differently from the
    previous suburban context of T2.3, here the algorithms should also take into account the ground characteristics, extending the
    multi-layer framework with, for example, the layer of the population density and the sheltering factor, as well as a layer for dynamic
    events. The routing algorithms will consider the strategies proposed in T3.1 (to adapt the QoS to the applications) and in T3.2 (for a
    reliable and resilient flight). In fact, due to the dynamicity of the events, the risk layers can even change over time (e.g., in localized
    fairs the concentration of people can significantly increase) or in case of exceptional events (e.g., earthquakes or tornadoes that
    create new obstacles). Therefore, these algorithms must also be able to recompute the drone’s path on-the-fly. In an urban
    environment, we also expect to deal with multiple drones that perform different tasks at the same time. This aspect introduces the
    problem that two or more UAVs can collide together during their flight. Therefore, we need to study and devise efficient and resilient
    scheduling algorithms in order to guarantee that multiple UAVs do not fly in the same area or the same corridor. An approach to
    solve this problem can consider the tessellation of the 3D space in cubes, and then assign a cube to each drone with some policies.
    Along corridors the strategy could be to let the drones fly at different heights, avoiding so to occupy the same horizontal line.
    However, in the extreme case that too many UAVs are flying in the same area, they should be opportunely re-routed on different,
    and possibly longer, paths, satisfying the required application constraints. This would introduce feasibility issues since UAVs are
    energy-constrained, and hence the energy required for the new path could not be sufficient. If this happens, the drones should be
    able to perform a safe landing on intermediate checkpoints. Methodologically, whenever possible, we will model the problems that
    we face as optimization problems. We will study their computational complexity, and if they are tractable, we will propose optimal
    solutions, otherwise, approximated solutions and heuristics will be devised.
