  <div class="container text-center">
    <h2>State of the art</h2>
    <p class="text-left">Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones, or more generally Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), are increasingly used in
        many applications and they are invoked for driving the Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) and the Urban Air Mobility (UAM). AAM
        encompasses the emerging aviation markets to safely develop an Air Transportation System (ATS) that moves people and cargo
    between places previously not served or underserved by aviation. The emerging activities in AAM are passenger and goods
    transportation, images and data collection, and traffic monitoring. UAM is a subset of AAM that uses small and automated aircraft to
    work at low altitudes in urban and suburban areas. So far, only manned/unmanned ground and manned aerial vehicles have been
    employed in these markets. Trucks are constrained by the terrain and suffer from highly congested infrastructures, while the use of
    planes is costly and unaffordable for most people. Hence, the use of UAS is a viable solution in many applications also because
    they do not emit greenhouse gas.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the EU, the operativity of UAS is subdivided into 3 categories: Open, Specific, and Certified. The operations in Open present a
    low risk and do not require a prior authorization before the flights. These operations must be done in Visual Line of Sight (VLoS), at
    low altitudes. The Specific category presents a medium risk indicating operations where one or more elements fall outside of the
    Open category. If authorized, these can be performed Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLoS). The Certified category concerns missions
    with a high risk, such as the transport of dangerous goods, operations in overcrowded areas, or the transport of people. So,
    excluding the Open operativity which is fully regulated and implemented, and the Certified one which is not defined yet, the
    operativity of UAS in Specific is currently in a state of “limbo” susceptible to be now updated.
    <br>
    <br>
    To enable Specific operativity, in the EU there are currently 3 ways, i.e., by a NOtice To AirMen (NOTAM) authorization, by
    Extended Visual Line of Sight (EVLoS) flights, or by the exploitation of “corridors” or “polygons”. A NOTAM isolates a certain area,
    and the risk is lowered because only the authorized UAV operation can use that area. However, it is not a flexible tool since it must
    be requested several days in advance, and it is unsuitable for a massive drone use. An EVLoS flight emulates a
    BVLoS flight by exploiting additional operators. The original UAV operator seamlessly passes the control to other operators that
    continue observing the UAV in VLoS. However, an ad-hoc “human” infrastructure is still necessary to be deployed, and special
    permissions are required too. Finally, the exploitation of “corridors” (e.g., high-voltage transmission lines) or “polygons” (e.g., closed
    fields), is the solution closest to BVLoS flights in a low risk scenario, but it lacks generality. Here, multiple UAVs are in charge of a
    portion of the area having their own smart docking station where to recharge and to send back information.
    <br>
    <br>
    To pursue flexible and scalable BVLoS flights, there are two big challenges: risk and remote control of the drone. The technology that
    controls the UAV must be aware of the level of ground and air risk. The ground risk depends on the concentration of people over
    places in case of some malfunctioning. The presence of buildings, towers, and trees can slightly mitigate the ground risk since
    they can act as shields or shelters, but they also represent obstacles during the flight. The air risk is coupled with possible
    crashes with other manned/unmanned objects that occupy the air space. The air risks seriously increase with the presence of
    malicious vehicles (ground or aerial) whose goal is to compromise the security of the flights.
    Concerning the remote control, a UAV must communicate its position anytime so that its route can be monitored by the ground, and
    possibly modified by providing new tasks while getting real time updates from the UAV. Establishing reliable BVLoS links supported
    by some communications infrastructure is the so called connectivity challenge. Since thinking of deploying an ad-hoc
    infrastructure for communicating is not sustainable, it is realistic to rely on already available ones like those used for ground users
    (cellular). There are several generations of networks already deployed (e.g., 4/5G) that can provide BVLoS links with different
    characteristics (e.g., bandwidth, latency) suitable for different types of UAVs, and types of applications.
    <br>
    <br>
    To sum up, the risk and connectivity are the two challenges to consider and to integrate when routing the UAVs in Specific BVLoS
    missions. The risk has to be assessed while defining the UAV trajectory, which is feasible only if the UAV is under constant radio
    control.

    <h2>Project impact</h2>
    <p class="text-left">
        The use of UAVs continues to grow and evolve globally. The technology has proven to provide many technological, social, and
industrial benefits enabling the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) concept and helping the decarbonization of the territory. For example, UAVs
can be used as a critical tool to support numerous use cases and public safety efforts. These include, e.g., inspections of critical
infrastructure, smart agriculture, and operations involving the delivery of supplies and packages to consumers. Unfortunately, the
use of drones is still confined to the Visual Line of Sight (VLoS) scenario, and nevertheless, both the research and industry
communities are continuously pushing and putting money towards this emerging technology. Therefore, to unlock the full economic
potential of commercial drone operations (as well as scientific and other civilian utilization), flights must be operated Beyond Visual
Line of Sight (BVLoS). This will allow drones to simply accomplish more in a single flight and ultimately allow operators to benefit
from long-distance drone operation, providing maximum cost-effectiveness.
<br><br>
One of the first applications that would be fundamental by enabling the BVLoS flight is the delivery of sanitary goods, such as blood
or organs, in time-critical emergency applications. Just imagine a situation where a patient is waiting for an urgent transplant, and
the ambulance that carries the required stuff is stuck on the highway due to a heavy traffic jam. Therefore, it would be extremely
crucial to deliver the sanitary goods in time, by using a UAV flying BVLoS, because every additional lost minute can be detrimental to
the patient. Once the transportation of sanitary goods will be consolidated and accepted by the industrial community, other
subsequent delivery drone-based applications can be enabled accordingly, e.g., the delivery of small packages containing
lightweight items, such as food and beverages. What we are envisioning is not so unrealistic since now other administrations,
organizations, and companies are arguing that a public transportation system fully relying on unmanned vehicles (such as large
copters) could be realized in a not too far future from today. This goes towards the spirit of a sustainable environment with no
greenhouse gas emissions and renewable sources. So, we firmly believe that our project will guarantee immediate benefits and a
broad impact in the mid-long term.

The acquired knowledge concerning the risk awareness, relying on many layers considering different heights and typologies, will
allow relatively safe flights of drones. We are aware that drones can have failures, and it is impossible to guarantee 100% safety
when we talk about vehicles (either ground or aerial ones). However, our investigation will create proper maps which characterize
the ground risk level so the drones can avoid areas with a higher risk in favor of other ones much less hazardous. These maps can be
also exploited by any VLoS/BVLoS application since the UAVs can suffer from failures anyway (e.g., broken propeller). Interestingly,
even other applications that make use of manned aerial applications could rely on these maps, such as search and rescue operations
after disastrous events, monitoring of traffic jams, and so on. Technological innovation and industrial application In order to
guarantee an efficient, reliable, safe, and secure BVLoS flight of drones, some new technologies are required to be implemented on
current commercial drones. Indeed, since this kind of flight is not permitted yet, drone manufacturers did/do not expect to equip
their UAVs with the suitable onboard technology that would allow them to fly BVLoS. To this end, the new drones should be equipped
with additional capabilities in order to fly without the direct intervention of the ground control station (GCS) or the remote controller.
Therefore, the new commercial UAVs must have slots for SIM cards for being connected to the Internet. The manufacturers should
consider different radio bands for the connection capability in order to guarantee that the UAV operativity can work in any country
(since different countries can have different usage of bands). To further extend the connectivity, the drones should be possibly
equipped with special connectors able to establish satellite connections. However, the cost for data transmissions (particularly
broadband data) is currently high at the moment, and hence, due to the expected and massive employment of drones with satellite
capabilities, such a cost will decrease accordingly.
<br><br>
Concerning the basic risk awareness of drones, it can be created with a suitable and large set of onboard sensors that can perceive
and detect possible risks in the surroundings. At the moment, only the most expensive drones are equipped with proximity sensors,
cameras, and wind sensors, altogether able to detect real-time hazards. Indeed, mid- and low-cost drones only have a limited set of
sensors (if nothing), and they could not be employed for a safe flight. Hence, the industrial community must equip all their UAVs with
new enhanced sensors. Parallelly, the flight controller of drones should combine the information gathered by these sensors and
make opportune decisions during a BVLoS flight in case of exceptional events, e.g., an unexpected obstacle close to drones,
unforeseen drainage of the batteries, and so on. In other words, the new flight controllers should be suitably trained with some form
of artificial intelligence. Moreover, we will create a shared access point for the UAV operators which includes all the risk maps of
different layers, made available as a web service. These maps, constantly updated, can be consulted by the operators in a real-time
manner, making then the BVLoS trajectories much safer.

    <h2>Scientific community reinforcement</h2>
    <p class="text-left">
        UNIPG, as the leading RU of this project, thanks to the long-term and fruitful collaboration with the Missouri University of Science &
Technology (S&T), USA, will eventually create a bridge for evaluating the possibility of using drones in a BVLoS scenario. As for Nov
2022, the current regulation concerning the BVLoS flight of drones in the US is a little bit ahead with respect to what is happening in
the UE. Therefore, we plan to, if possible, interact more and more with colleagues from the Computer Science and Engineering Dept
with the goal to do preliminary experiments by using real drones in a confined scenario. To this end, we will encourage exchange
periods during and after the existence of the project among this consortium and Missouri S&T. Other contacts will be established
with other research projects in which RUs are involved, and research communities and interest groups for promoting community
building. In particular, the project will create synergies with researchers from the HALY.ID project (UNIPG), which established a
collaboration for the use of two drones (DJI Matrice 300 and Mini 3 Pro), and from ADVANCE H2020 MSCA project (UNIFI), which
established a collaboration network on safety and dependability evaluation and assessment.

    <h2>Dissemination</h2>
    <p class="text-left">
        The production of research publications will be targeted throughout the whole project. We expect a productive scientific
dissemination, which can be quantified in 6 top-rank journal papers and 6 conference papers (on average, 3 journal and 3
conference papers per year). Additionally, at least 2 journal publications and 2 conference publications will be co-authored by ALL
the RUs, which describes the proposed approach as a cohesive work, where all RUs have a fundamental role in its success. At least
green open access will be provided to all scientific publications, or gold open access when funds are available. Scientific venues
sponsored by international technical societies (IEEE, ACM) will be targeted. Target top-rank conferences are: IEEE Intl. Conf. on
Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN), Intl. Symp. on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS), IEEE Intl. Conf. on Computer
Communications (INFOCOM), IEEE Intl. Conf. on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom), ACM Intl. Conf. on Modeling,
Analysis and Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems (MSWiM). Target journals are IEEE and ACM Transactions, including: ACM
Trans. on Cyber-Physical Systems, IEEE Trans. on Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE/ACM Trans. on Networking, IEEE Trans.
on Network and Service Management, IEEE Trans. on Wireless Communications, IEEE Trans. on Green Communications and
Networking. To promote the dissemination of results to the community, 2 dissemination events will be organized, in the form of
workshops co-located in top conferences among those previously cited.
<br><br>
Data and software. All software prototypes and data will be public with open licenses through GitHub and Zenodo. Data will be
managed following the European guidelines on Open Science to maximize the impact and diffusion of the knowledge generated by
the project, e.g., using methodologies for collecting, storing, and sharing data according to the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
Reusable (FAIR) principles.
Communication. For communication with the general public, a website will be set up, and communication through social media (e.g.,
LinkedIn and Twitter) will be performed, by exploiting the communication channels available at our institutions.
Teaching and training. The project will leverage synergies with several ongoing educational activities. UNIPG will include project
results in courses related to “Algorithms and data structures”, UNIFI to “Dependable and secure systems” courses, and POLITO to
“Communication and network systems” courses, all at the MSc/Ph.D. level.

    <h2>Exploitation</h2>
    <p class="text-left">
        Each RU commits to making available to the others all the required background knowledge, including software code and data. Each
RU owns the foreground knowledge it produced; knowledge produced by more RUs is jointly owned by them. RUs commit to making
the foreground knowledge public. If prospective patenting is envisioned, all RUs commit to delay public dissemination on the subject
until the patent is submitted, but for a maximum of 4 months after the identification of the patentable contribution. In case of
exploitation potential, the RUs will refer to the technology transfer offices available at their institution for advice and for the
necessary support to define an appropriate business plan and course of action.
